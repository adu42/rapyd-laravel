rapyd-laravel
=============


### IMPORTANT
#### this repo in this repository has been abandoned in favor of 

https://github.com/zofe/rapyd-livewire

The reason is that livewire has proven to be a great foundation for building responsive widgets, simplifying them and making them testable.

However there is still the need to have a library (on top of livewire) that has the building blocks to quickly build our applications in a robust and orderly way. Especially admin boards.

So Rapyd, as far as possible, will still be brought forward.
